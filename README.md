# PCB-Revision-History
A brief history of TEC-1 PCBs and their design variations.


The TEC-1 PCB has undegone several revisions over time. Although the designs are all very similar and generally software bacwards-compatible (Same meory mapIO port map, keyboard layout etc.), there are some subtle differences that may be of interest to collectors and the like.

This list will serve to attempt to document the evolution of the design both at TE, and post-TE time.
